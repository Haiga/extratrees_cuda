# Optimizing Extremely Randomized Trees with GPUs

*In collaboration with [Kenil Tanna](https://github.com/avidkenil).*

## Introduction

[Random Forests](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) are often the textbook example of highly parallel algorithms that are unsuitable for GPUs. In this project, we propose and evaluate our CUDA implementation of [Extremely Randomized Trees](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-006-6226-1) (or ExtraTrees), a variant of Random Forests which are more amenable to GPU-driven parallel programming.
